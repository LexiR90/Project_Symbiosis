# Project_Symbiosis: Towards a Digital Subconscious
Project_Symbiosis is a software system designed to act as a local context management layer for physical devices. It facilitates the:

Generation of context information about a device's state, environment, and user interactions.
Maintenance of this context information, ensuring it stays accurate and up-to-date.
Inter-device/instance Integration, enabling seamless information sharing and coordinated behavior between multiple devices or instances of the software running on the same device.
Vision: The Digital Subconscious

Project_Symbiosis aspires to evolve beyond basic context management and move towards the concept of a "digital subconscious." This entails the software becoming an intelligent layer that can:

Dynamically Leverage Resources: Based on user activity and device state, the system could intelligently utilize available resources (local processing power, external APIs, etc.) to automate tasks or enhance user experience. Imagine a system that utilizes idle CPU cycles for background data processing or leverages cloud resources when local device capabilities are limited.
Proactive Assistance: By monitoring context and user behavior patterns, the system could anticipate user needs and proactively offer assistance. This could involve suggesting relevant information, automating repetitive tasks, or dynamically adjusting device settings for optimal performance.
Current Stage and Development Focus

The current version of Project_Symbiosis lays the foundation for this future vision. It demonstrates core functionalities like data loading and interaction with external APIs (e.g., Google Drive). The focus for future development will be on:

Context Awareness: Implementing mechanisms to gather and maintain rich context information about the user, device, and environment.
Resource Management: Developing algorithms to intelligently allocate and leverage available resources based on context.
User Modeling: Building user profiles to understand behavior patterns and anticipate needs.
Collaboration and Open-source Potential

Project_Symbiosis is designed with collaboration in mind. The codebase is structured to be modular and extensible, allowing for contributions from the developer community. We believe this open-source approach will foster innovation and accelerate the development of the "digital subconscious" concept.
