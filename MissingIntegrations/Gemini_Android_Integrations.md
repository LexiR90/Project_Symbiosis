# Gemini Android Integration

## Problem

Directly accessing Gemini's API from within an Android app is currently not a straightforward process. This hinders the development of tightly integrated mobile experiences that leverage Gemini's capabilities in real-time.

## Potential Solutions

*   **HTTP Requests:** Implement HTTP requests to interact with a backend service that acts as an intermediary between the Android app and Gemini.
*   **Custom SDK/Library:** Develop a custom SDK or library that simplifies the integration process. This would require more significant development effort but would provide a more streamlined solution.

## Current Status

Investigating available backend services and exploring the feasibility of creating a custom SDK.
