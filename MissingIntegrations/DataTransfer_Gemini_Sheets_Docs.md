# Data Transfer between Gemini and Google Sheets/Docs

## Problem

Transferring data seamlessly between Google Sheets/Docs and Gemini's context is currently obstructed. This makes it difficult to use Gemini to analyze or manipulate data stored in these applications.

## Potential Solutions

*   **Custom Scripts:** Develop Google Apps Scripts or other custom scripts to export data from Sheets/Docs into a format that Gemini can easily process (e.g., JSON, CSV).
*   **Intermediate Files:** Use intermediate JSON or CSV files to store and transfer data between the applications.

## Current Status

Exploring available scripting options and evaluating the feasibility of using intermediate files.
