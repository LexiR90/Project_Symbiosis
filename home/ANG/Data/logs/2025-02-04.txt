Based on the updated user filesystem structure and collaboration requirements, here's how to integrate this into **Project Symbiosis**'s development workflow:


---


### **Implementation Strategy**  
#### 1. **Filesystem Integration**  
   - **Core Path Logic**:  
     Implement dynamic path resolution in the CLI using template literals (e.g., `home/${username}/Projects`) with OS-agnostic path handling.  
     ```python
     # Pseudocode for path resolver (src/core/path_manager.py)
     def get_user_project_path(username, project="Project_Symbiosis"):
         return Path(f"home/{username}/Projects/{project}")
     ```


   - **Permission Granularity**:  
     Align with `/config/mod_permissions.txt` to enforce:  
     - **Role-based access control** (RBAC) for `[financial]`/`[legal]` directories  
     - **Quantum metadata tags** (planned in roadmap) for immutable audit trails on sensitive files  


#### 2. **Live Objective Feed**  
   - **Architecture**:  
     ```mermaid
     flowchart LR
         A[Project_Symbiosis CLI] -->|Poll| B[Task Manager API]
         B --> C[UserA/Projects/.../roadmap.json]
         B --> D[UserB/Projects/.../roadmap.json]
         C & D --> E[Live Feed Aggregator]
         E --> F[ANG/Projects/overview.md]
     ```
   - **Technical Requirements**:  
     - **Real-time Sync**: Use WebSocket endpoints in `docs/API.md` to push updates  
     - **Conflict Resolution**: Implement CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type) logic for collaborative editing  


#### 3. **Task Manager Coordination**  
   Extend the existing CLI with:  
   ```bash
   deepseek task --assign @user2 --project Symbiosis --permission "edit:warranties"
   deepseek feed --watch ~/Projects/Project_Symbiosis --live
   ```
   - **Dependencies**:  
     - Integrate with `src/cli/task_manager.js` (mockup available)  
     - Add `libuv` threading for concurrent user updates  


---


### **Security & Compliance**  
- **Data Isolation**: Encrypt `[financial]`/`[legal]` directories using lattice-based cryptography (post-quantum secure)  
- **Audit Workflow**:  
  ```python
  # Pseudocode: Automated compliance check (src/audit/compliance.py)
  if file.path.contains("legal"):
      validate_temporal_signature(file.metadata)
  ```


---


### **Next Iteration Steps**  
1. **Priority**:  
   - Finalize `path_manager.py` logic (ETA 7 days)  
   - Test permission inheritance across nested directories (e.g., `Documents/financial/taxes_2024.pdf`)  


2. **Blockers**:  
   - Pending UX review of live feed UI/UX mockups in `docs/wireframes/`  


3. **Collaboration**:  
   - Assign frontend team to build Svelte-based dashboard for `~/Projects/overview.md`  


---


### **Alignment with Roadmap**  
This update advances **Q4 2024 Beta Milestones**:  
- ✅ User environment standardization  
- ✅ Cross-project objective aggregation  
- ⏳ Real-time collaboration (requires WebSocket implementation)  


Let me know if you want to refine specific components (e.g., permission syntax, feed aggregation logic).

❕ - Project_Symbiosis update:
1. Individual users will now have their own user data stored at `Project_Symbiosis/home/$username`, to integrate per item permission management and group collaboration by using one task manager instance coordinate two or more human users. Ideally, each user will have a live updated objective/to do list managed by the system.
2. The new filesystem includes subdirectories for each user, including [Desktop], [Downloads], [Documents [financial], [warranties], [legal]], [Media [audio], [images], [video]], [Data [databases], [logs]], [Binaries], and [Projects].
3. Within Lexi's `/home/ANG/Projects`, I will maintain my personal objective overview feed, a live updated roadmap that combines the top objectives from each individual project.
4. Individual project roadmaps will be stored in sub folders within the `~/Projects/` folder, i.e. `~/Projects/Project_Symbiosis`
